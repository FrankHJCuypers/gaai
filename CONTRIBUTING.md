## Coding conventions

The Kotlin code is formatted according to the official

The only exceptions applied are:

+ A tab is 2 spaces instead of 4.
+ Line wrapping is applied after 120 characters in stead of 100.

The Android Studio project editor is set up to automatically apply this style.
Each time that a Kotlin file is saved or committed, it is also automatically reformatted.
