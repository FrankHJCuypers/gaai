# Privacy Policy

## Gaai App Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes the types of data collected by the *Gaai* App,
the purposes for collecting such data, and how we handle, store, and protect that information. 

## Data collected directly by Gaai

*Gaai* does not collect any personal data.

The only data stored by *Gaai* is the information related to the Nexxtender chargers that you connect to as
explained in
[Add a Nexxtender device](https://github.com/FrankHJCuypers/gaai/blob/master/README.md#add-a-nexxtender-device).
For each device you connect to the following data is stored locally on your mobile phone by *Gaai*:

- PN: Product number
- SN: Serial number
- MAC: the MAC
- Service Data number

This data is not shared by other apps or servers external to your phone.

## Data collected by Github

Some buttons or text will forward you to the *Gaai* Github project when clicked.
This may result in data collection.
Please review the 
[GitHub General Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)
for more information.

## Google Analytics and Crashlytics

Since version 1.1.0, *Gaai* uses the Google Analytics tools to compile anonymous statistical reports on user activity.
We use this information to improve the quality of *Gaai*.

Since version 1.1.0, *Gaai* uses the Google Firebase Crashlytics tools to compile anonymous crash reports.
This way we are made aware of any crashes in the field including a stack dump
of where the crash occurred in the code.
We use this to analyze the crash and fix it in future versions if possible.

What Google does with this data is restricted by the *Google Analytics Terms of Use* and the
*Google Privacy Policy*.

Consult Google for information on how to turn this data collection off.

Since version 1.1.1, only the **firebase** and **debug** [build types](DEVELOPMENT.md#build-types) 
include the Google Analytics and Crashlytics tools.
The **release** build type no longer includes the Google Analytics and Crashlytics tools.
If you don't want your data to be collected by Google Analytics or Crashlytics, you must use the **release** build type.
The drawback is that the *Gaai* developer will not receive any information about crashes you encounter,
making it less likely that such problems will be detected and solved.

Users should frequently verify this page in order to be aware of any changes.
This file is maintained on GitHub, which allows users to easily track changes.

policy periodically in order to be informed of any changes.
