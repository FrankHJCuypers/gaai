<p>The goal of this app is to control the Nexxtender Home and Nexxtender Mobile charger without requiring the <a href='https://www.appbrain.com/app/com.powerdale.nexxtender' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>Android Nexxtmove</a> app. The Android Nexxtmove app is the official app for controlling the Nexxtender chargers and for syncing billing information to the <a href='https://www.nexxtmove.me/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>Nexxtmove.me</a> website for refunding. Both the Nexxtmove app and the Nexxtmove.me website require a username and password to login. Without it, it is impossible to use the Nexxtmove app and therefore impossible to operate the Nexxtender Home charger, which has no UI or input device on its own. If you no longer have a valid username and password for the Nexxtmove app, using <i>Gaai</i> is an option.</p><p><br><b>Features:</b></p><ul><li>Only requires to install Gaai.</li><li>No additional hardware required.</li><li>No www.Nexxtmove.me account required.</li><li>Connects over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the Nexxtender Home or Nexxtender Mobile.</li><li>Finds and connects to the device based on its PN and SN.
